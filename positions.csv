projects,TRUE,Chaoyang English Project,Beijing BISS International School,"Beijing, CHINA",2012,2014,"The Chaoyang English Project is one of 3 major projects being run by Chaoyang Education Committee, which is the largest municipal district in Beijing. From the initial 5 partner schools, there are now 11 top district schools (see list below); with 15 foreign teachers; 3 teacher trainers; 40+ local teachers & almost 10,000 students having had their learning lives enriched as a result of this project.",The project has 3 major objectives - to train local English teachers in current international ESL/TESOL methodology & pedagogy; to improve local English teachers' English levels; and to improve students' English ability and increase their enjoyment of learning.,"To meet these 3 objectives, the Chaoyang English Project utilizes a team-teaching arrangement whereby local teachers are partnered with an experienced foreign ESL teacher with whom they plan lessons, teach and then reflect on each lesson. Ongoing training and support is provided for the partnerships throughout the year - initially there is a 3-day intensive before the start of the school year; then weekly training sessions for the first month & bi-weekly thereafter. Teachers have regular lesson observation & feedback sessions, and there is separate regular feedback on their lesson planning. Training sessions provide training in current methodology & pedagogy and outlines for how to teach different kinds of skill-based lessons."
